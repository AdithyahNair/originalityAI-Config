Originality.ai is a software tool that provides highly accurate AI Detection and Plagiarism checks for text. 
However, due to the lack of a csrf-token and very high rate-limit values, there is a great chance of DDos attacks. 
This config explores the vulnerability that can be exploited for this attack.
